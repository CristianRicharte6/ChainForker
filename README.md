# ChainForker üöÄ

## Overview

Welcome to ChainForker ‚Äì your go-to service for effortlessly forking blockchain networks and managing token balances like a pro! üåêüí∞ This service is powered by the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment, making local Ethereum forks a breeze for your development and [hardhat-deal](https://github.com/Rubilmax/hardhat-deal).

## Features

‚ú® **Local Forking:** Create local forks of Ethereum chains with lightning speed, tailoring them to your development whims.

üí∏ **Token Wizardry:** Add ERC-20 token balances to specific user addresses on your forked chains, because who doesn't love a little extra magic?

## Getting Started

Ready to unleash the power of ChainForker? Here's your spellbook:

1. **Set Up the `.env` Magic Portal:** Copy the enchanted `.env.example` file and sprinkle it with your specific configuration. At the very least, reveal the secret of the RPC node to fork and the chain ID.

2. **Summon the Service:** In your command realm, chant the following incantation:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Enter the Fork Dimension:** Your local fork will materialize at http://127.0.0.1:8545. Dive in and let the adventure begin!

4. **Deploy to the Clouds:** For a grander spectacle, consider deploying ChainForker to a hosting service. Let others connect to the forked chain and experience the magic firsthand. Services like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) can host your creation with ease.

## Adding Token Balances

To gift the power of any ERC-20 token to your chosen ones on the forked chain, cast the following spell:

```bash
npx hardhat deal <receiver> <token-address> <amount> --network fork
```

Replace the placeholders with real-world values:

- `<receiver>`: The chosen one's Ethereum address, ready to receive the token magic.
- `<token-address>`: The enchanted address of the ERC-20 token contract.
- `<amount>`: The mystical amount of the ERC-20 token to bestow upon your chosen one.

Example:

```bash
npx hardhat deal 0x976EA74026E726554dB657fA54763abd0C3a0aa9 0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619 1000000000000000000 --network fork
```

## Notes from the Wizard's Scroll
